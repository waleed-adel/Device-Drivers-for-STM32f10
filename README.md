# Device Drivers for STM32f10
 Full Software Interfaces for STM 32(ARM Cortex-M3) peripherals and Implemented simple hardware applications.
 ## Implemented Peripherals:
 1- RCC (Reset and control clock).
 2- NVIC (Nested vector interrupt controller).
 3- STK (Systick timer).
 4- GPIO (General purpose I/O).
 5- DMA (Direct memory access controller).
 6- FLASH.
 7- USART Supporting two modes:
	a) Reception and Transmission using DMA Mode.
	b) LIN (local interconnection network) Mode.
